<b>ebro.xml</b> is the simplest one to use - an 11-waypoint plan of the major things to 
watch out for. 
<br /><br />
<b>ebroMax.xml</b> is a monster 164-waypoint detailed plan of the route. 
<br /><br />
<b>ebroMax.gpx</b> is a version in .gpx format which FG can read. It is the intermediary 
file and is the output of the LittleNavMap software used to plan this route. 
<br /><br />
<b>ebroMax.pln</b> is the 'source-code' of the 
<a href="https://albar965.github.io/littlenavmap.html" target="_blank">LittleNavMap</a> version.

Takeoff will be from runway 25 of LERS (Reus) as soon after the meet-up time of 8pm BST as 
possible. <br />

Following every single bend of both rivers, the distance is 540nm (from sea to shining sea 
alone) plus about 40nm for the airport runs. I have been just about able to do this at 
300 KIAS with the SU-37, but it's not easy.
<br /><br />
If the manoeuvrability of your particular operator-aircraft combination for the night 
won't allow this, you may need to cut a few corners. The ebroMax.xml plan is 463nm and 
ebro.xml is 348nm. The straight line distance between start and finish is just over 260nm.  
Choose wisely!
<br /><br />
I will probably pootle along at about 250 KIAS following the route in general, so people 
can follow me more easily - whilst anyone wanting to play the boy-racer can go faster and 
leave no bend unflown.
<br /><br />
It would be nice to do the full length of both rivers but, being realistic, an 8-pm 
departure is unlikely.  It's unfortunate that LERS is so far from the Ebro estuary.  
The most likely start to the night will therefore involve 
going directly to WP6:

  This will give us an extra 15 minutes or so.<br /><br />

For training/familiarisation (if you are considering this at all) there is a AI scenario
